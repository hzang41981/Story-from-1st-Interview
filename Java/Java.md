# Abstraction VS. Interface:
Similarity:
Abstraction；
Cannnot have instance;
Difference:
Type of methods: Interface -> abstract methods. Abstract class -> abstract (optional, not required), non-abstract methods, default, and static methods;
Final Variables: Variables in a Java interface are by default final;
Type of variables: Interface -> static and final;
Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. Interface can’t provide the implementation of an abstract class.
Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword “implements” and an abstract class can be extended using the keyword “extends”.
Multiple implementations: An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
