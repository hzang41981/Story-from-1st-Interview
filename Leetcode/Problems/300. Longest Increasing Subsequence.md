# Dynamic List to Find Longest Increasing Subsequence in O(n)

Better solution than [Reference](https://github.com/hzang41981/leetcode-master/blob/master/problems/0300.%E6%9C%80%E9%95%BF%E4%B8%8A%E5%8D%87%E5%AD%90%E5%BA%8F%E5%88%97.md);

The ith element of List represents the value to be greater than to have an increasing subsequence of length i+1.

Update rule:
1. if larger than end of List => append;
2. if smaller or equal to the end of list => find the index of the first element that is samller (but not equal to) to the current value, update the next element (because when the current value is added, the length increase by one);

Attention:
1. res update rule is just simply +1;
2. pter can out of index;

```python3
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if not stack or nums[i] > stack[-1]:
                stack.append(nums[i])
                res = res + 1
            else:
                pter = len(stack) - 2
                while pter > -1 and nums[i] <= stack[pter]:
                    pter -= 1
                stack[pter + 1] = nums[i]
        return res
```
